### Domain Modeling 
* I typed below the summary notes from the Domain article.  I find this summary very useful.
* Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. 
* A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.
* Build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
* Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
* Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
* Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
* Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
* Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

### Duckett HTML Book Chapter 6: “Tables” (pp.126-145) 
* Table represents information in a grid format.
* <table> element is used to add tables to a web page 
* <tr> element creates the rows of the table
* <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot> elements to split long tables
* <td> stands for table data.
* between <td> and </td> are the content of the table cell.
* <th> stands for table header

### Duckett JSS Book Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)
* Generally speaking, a function is a "subprogram" that can be called 
* Values can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value.
* To return a value other than the default, a function must have a return statement that specifies the value to return. 
* JS has built-in objects like String, Number, Math, Date.
