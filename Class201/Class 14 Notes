# Class 14 Notes

* What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team?
* I am citing the major findings of the article below;
* - For Project Aristotle, research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. 
* - There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. 
* - But Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.
* - Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences.
* — Like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel — that can’t really be optimized.
