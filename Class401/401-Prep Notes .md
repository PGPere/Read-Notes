# 401 Prep-Linux Notes

### These are my notes:

Command Line is the text interface for controlling my computer 

I can create a hidden file or directory with it's name beginning with a .  

Linux is case sensitive

A file location is relative to where we currently are in the file system.

Absolute path relative to the root of the file system.

Linux does not care about extensions because it looks inside the file to figure the file type

du -sh ./* is use to find the size of of your current directory.

df -h displays how much disk space is used and also free.
