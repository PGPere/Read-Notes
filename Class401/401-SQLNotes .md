# SQL Bolt Lesson

These are my key learnings from the SQL Bolt Lessons:
SQL is use to extract and manipulate tables
Statements I learned include: SELECT, WHERE, DISTINCT, INNER JOIN, ORDER BY, LIMIT, OPFFSET, INSERT INTO, DELETE FROM, DROP, CREATE TABLE others.
Creating tables include constraints (e.g. Primary Key or NOT)
