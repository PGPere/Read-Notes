# THE PAST, PRESENT & FUTURE OF LOCAL STORAGE FOR WEB APPLICATIONS
* A way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser.
* The data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you. 
* Data is never transmitted to the remote web server.
* It is implemented natively in web browsers, so it is available even when third-party browser plugins are not.
* Store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. 
* The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats. 
* The data is actually stored as a string. Other than strings, use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved 
* data into the expected JavaScript datatype.
